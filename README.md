# React Notes App

*This app lets you create sticky-note-like notes and edit them.  I used a Firebase database to store the notes so that multiple users can edit from different windows at the same time.  The notes are compatible with markdown.*

## What Worked Well
I think I was able to get all the basic functionality working properly.  I also got the notes to only go to a certain size and to scale images so that they would fit inside the notes.

## What Didn't
I had some trouble getting the draggable features of the notes to work properly.  I couldn't quite figure out how to get the notes to be contained inside the note-section; I ended up just limiting them on the top and left side, but they can move in the right and bottom directions unbounded.  It also took me a little time to get used to the passing of functions as props in react.
